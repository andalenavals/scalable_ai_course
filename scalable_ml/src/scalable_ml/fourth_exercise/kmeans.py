class KMeans:
    r"""
    K-Means clustering algorithm. An implementation of Lloyd's algorithm [1].

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_clusters : int
        The number of clusters to form as well as the number of centroids to generate.
    max_iter : int
        Maximum number of iterations of the k-means algorithm for a single run.
    tol : float
        Relative tolerance with regard to inertia to declare convergence.
    repetition_nr : int
        Determines the number of repetitions of KMeans algorithms (solution with lowest inertia is returned)

    Notes
    -----
    The average complexity is given by :math:`O(k \cdot n \cdot T)`, were n is the number of samples and :math:`T` is the number of iterations.
    In practice, the k-means algorithm is very fast, but it may fall into local minima. That is why it can be useful
    to restart it several times.
